<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My questioning of universities sparked my initial interest in empirical studies. I studied Chinese language and literature in my first year, which represents the most difficult reading tasks of Chinese humanities majors. Despite investing significant time in texts dating back thousands of years, I discovered their disconnection from everyday life. I aspire to enhance my understanding of society and change it. So I turned my attention to social science, especially sociology. My passion and potential led me to be approved by the committee to switch major into sociology. I have proven the committee's vision: In every semester starting from the 21-22-3 semester, I achieved a GPA above 3.8, ranking high in the top 5%.

My research interest includes organizationalÂ sociology, inequalities and social network analysis.
